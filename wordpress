This one i got relatively easily!
Was able to get the website set up, and get my blog up and running.
had one issue with the blog name - pay attention to what you type in the instance. must match what you are typing. 
  ex. blog2 is NOT the same as blog1 or just blog
  when in doubt, exit, take a breath and start again.
