koha install
initially spent 5 hours, but could not get the page to work. tried to uninstall, but cannot uninstall, learned that along with the omeka install since 
catching up with both of them. 
major issue
site not working - reverts to https
 learned in the chat with SB that you can not uninstall how i was trying to do it. also, stop using sudo in the root!!!
chat is amazing for help and made me not feel so alone while trying to work on this, since i was alone while doing it.
went back through everything again, and looked at comment from SB about the listen 80. need to add listen 8080 instead of changing listen 80 to 8080

feeling very stupid about this and seriously worried about linking everything together!
